   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!
************************************************* -->

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;
    <h4>Proximity for web design purposes means that similar or related elements should be grouped together, while those that are unrelated or dissimilar should be separated. In the case of our website we have good organization of related fields of information. All the new releases are grouped together and at a glance for the viewer. This is the same as you scroll down the field and find genres, most popular by genre, and most popular by age group. At the top of the page you will find a navigation bar for different parts of the site and at the bottom the find the navigation bar to download the app and social media.
